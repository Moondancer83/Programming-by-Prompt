# Diplomacy
This game started my programmer career back in the days but actually I was not able to finish the project.
I found a video on generating code with AI. This seems to be an interesting approach, so I dived into the topic.
In this project I want to test the capabilities of prompt engineering in the domain of coding and finishing up my long avaiting game.

## Rules
The ruleset of the board game Diplomacy can be found here: https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/ah/diplomacy_rules.pdf

## Documentation
For learning purposes I document all the prompts I give to the AI model. Each prompt and it's result become a commit.
